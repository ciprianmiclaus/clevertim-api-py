[Clevertim CRM](https://www.clevertim.com) Python API

Clevertim CRM is a simple CRM (web contact management) and it's intended for small businesses/small teams to keep track together of their contacts, notes, interactions with existing or potential customers.

It's a SAAS (software as a service) and it's written in Python. This repo implements an official Python API which allows developers to connect to a Clevertim account and manipulate it programmatically.
